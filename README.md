# The AM Marketplace

### Overview
The inspiration behind The AM Marketplace is the modern era of e-commerce where items ranging from electronics to groceries can be easily ordered and delivered straight to the doorstep. This application is a starting point towards tapping into this convenient and growing market.

The AM Marketplace is a point of sale application, designed to enable users to browse, select, and purchase items with ease.

### Stack
The application leverages a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. React.js was utilized for the front-end client, Express.js and Node.js were used for setting up the server-side, and MongoDB served as the application database.

### Features
The application consists of the following pages:

Home Page: This is the landing page where users can select categories and items to purchase.
Cart Page: Here, users can view items added to their cart and decide if they wish to proceed to checkout.
Receipts Page: After making a purchase, users can view their payment details here.
Items and Users Page: These pages are intended for administrator access only, mainly for future development purposes.
